  <meta content="LANFIRE's (LF) 2016 Remap (Remap) Forest Canopy Height (CH) describes the average height of the top of the canopy for a stand. In disturbed locations CH is calculated from linear regression equations derived from Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) plot data output, but at non-disturbed locations it is assigned the midpoint of Fuel Vegetation Height (FVH) forested classes. In some instances, LF Remap assumes the potential burnable biomass in the tree canopy has been accounted for in the surface fuel model. For example, young or short conifer stands where the trees are represented by a shrub type fuel model will not have canopy characteristics. LF Remap Annual Disturbance products are incorporated into CH to provide informed changes by disturbance type, severity, and time since disturbance (TSD). Annual Disturbance products provide a pre-disturbance scenario represented by LF Remap existing vegetation products, the reporting of pre-disturbance scenarios helps to calculate CH. Vegetation adjustments are then modeled in disturbance areas based on disturbance type and severity. CH is then used in the calculation of Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) and Canopy Base Height (CBH). CH supplies information for fire behavior models, such as FARSITE (Finney 1998), that can determine; the starting point for embers in the spotting model, wind reductions, and the volume of crown fuels. CH also has capable fuels functionality, capable fuels calculate TSD assignments for disturbed areas using an effective year. For example, year 2020 fuels may be calculated for the year 2020. This new process considers all the existing disturbances included in LF Remap and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2020 in this example), making the products &quot;2020 capable fuels.&quot; More information about capable fuels can be found at https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php.

             LANFIRE's (LF) 2016 Remap (Remap) Forest Canopy Height (CH) describes the average height of the top of the canopy for a stand. In disturbed locations CH is calculated from linear regression equations derived from Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) plot data output, but at non-disturbed locations it is assigned the midpoint of Fuel Vegetation Height (FVH) forested classes. In some instances, LF Remap assumes the potential burnable biomass in the tree canopy has been accounted for in the surface fuel model. For example, young or short conifer stands where the trees are represented by a shrub type fuel model will not have canopy characteristics.
             <br/>
             LF Remap Annual Disturbance products are incorporated into CH to provide informed changes by disturbance type, severity, and time since disturbance (TSD). Annual Disturbance products provide a pre-disturbance scenario represented by LF Remap existing vegetation products, the reporting of pre-disturbance scenarios helps to calculate CH. Vegetation adjustments are then modeled in disturbance areas based on disturbance type and severity. CH is then used in the calculation of Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) and Canopy Base Height (CBH). CH supplies information for fire behavior models, such as FARSITE (Finney 1998), that can determine; the starting point for embers in the spotting model, wind reductions, and the volume of crown fuels.

             CH also has capable fuels functionality, capable fuels calculate TSD assignments for disturbed areas using an effective year. For example, year 2020 fuels may be calculated for the year 2020. This new process considers all the existing disturbances included in LF Remap and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2020 in this example), making the products "2020 capable fuels."

              Purpose:
             </em>
             <dd>
              LF 2016 Remap (LF Remap) is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions. LF Remap represents circa 2016 ground conditions and is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF Remap has improved past methodologies and processes to incorporate current satellite imagery, contemporary data sources, and the latest software and hardware technologies. Final LF Remap products offer significant improvements to all previous LF versions (read more about versions here https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php).
              <br/>
              LF Remap products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives.
              <br/>
              Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.

               This product has 2020 capable fuels functionality. Units are meters * 10; to retrieve the actual canopy height for a given pixel, simply multiply the value by 0.1 or divide by 10.

                  Beginning in 2016 LF Remap products were created using recent advances in image compositing, tiling algorithms, and faster computing hardware to ensure that LF products remained relevant. LF Remap leveraged the Landsat archive, lidar data, and user contributed field plot data compiled into the LF Reference Database (LFRDB), to create new base map vegetation products. Reference resources included, but were not limited to, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program plot data (USFS https://fia.fs.fed.us/), Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent [(DSWE) USGS https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat], the National Land Cover Dataset [(NLCD) USGS https://www.mrlc.gov/data], and National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/]. To read more about LF reference resources go to https://www.landfire.gov/reference.php. Information about LF Remap product testing is available by request or via the website at https://www.landfire.gov.
