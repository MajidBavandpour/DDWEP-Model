Pyrogenic airborne particle deposition downwind from active wildland fires have been traditionally studied in the context of imminent risk of fire spotting via firebrands or long-distance transport of smoke particles (<10µm). We developed a framework for quantifying pyro-generation, transport, and deposition of intermediate-sized (1 to 2000 µm) airborne particles of ecological significance, forming a previously understudied footprint of wildfire deposition. The physics-based framework considers particle emissions and sensible heat generation that feed a convective plume lofting particle to different heights (based on size and density) and subsequently release them into prevailing wind for downstream deposition according to a ballistic equation. We harness a unique deposition dataset collected across sites situated 3 to 40 km from the fire line during the 2021 Caldor Fire. Combining observations of fire rate of spread, available fuel, and weather information with collected depositions during the fire enable preliminary testing of the modeling framework. The framework encompasses inherent assumptions and constraints regarding unknown variables (e.g., fraction of emitted particles, size distribution, and density), selected based on literature and physical plausibility. The modeling results demonstrate agreement with observed pyrogenic deposition patterns. This framework offers a new tool for researchers and land managers to better anticipate and assess the ecological impacts of wildfire-driven particulate deposition on downwind terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
